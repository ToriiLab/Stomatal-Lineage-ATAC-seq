# Stomatal-Lineage-ATAC-seq
Pipelines for THS motif analysis, PCA, and UMAP using our stomatal-lineage INTACT ATAC-seq data

This R markdown provides our motif analysis using Monocle3. Beginning from a motif x THS matrix, counts are pre-processed with PCA and embedded in two dimensions with UMAP. Example plots are provided for motif counts of specific TFs or families of TFs.
